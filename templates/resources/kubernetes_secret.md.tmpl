# Kubernetes Secret

Manage a Kubernetes Secret using this Terraform module.

In managed clusters, both attached and provisioned, you can create Kubernetes Secret that you can manage through Tanzu Mission Control.

To create a cluster secret, you must be associated with the cluster.admin role

The `tanzu-mission-control_kubernetes_secret` resource enables you to create cluster secret to a particular scope for management through Tanzu Mission Control.

You can optionally make export to true to make the secret available to all namespaces in the cluster.

## Policy Scope and Inheritance

In the Tanzu Mission Control resource hierarchy, there is currently one levels at which you can specify cluster secret resources:
- **Kubernetes objects** - `cluster` block under `scope` sub-resource   

**Note:**
The scope parameter is mandatory in the schema and the user needs to add one of the defined scopes to the script for the provider to function.
Only one scope per resource is allowed.
